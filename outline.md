intro
    everyone prepared?
    round of previous experience
    team up
    follow along, ask questions, ...

digital circuits
    combinatorial
        logic cells
    sequential
        clocks
        registers
        (block) RAM

FPGAs
    vs ASIC
    how do they work?
        LUTs
        dedicated blocks
        flashing
    example: iCE40
    applications

HDLs
    constraints compared to programming languages
    traditional HDLs
        Verilog & VHDL
        type safety
        verbosity
        "low-level", lack of abstraction
        semantic mismatch
            imperative description of sequential processes
    Clash
        history
        (short Haskell type-level intro? or interspersed?)
        how does it deal with HW constraints?
